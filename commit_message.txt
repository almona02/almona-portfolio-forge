feat: Implement performance optimizations and Vercel Analytics

This commit addresses several performance-related issues and integrates Vercel Analytics:

- Updated `three.js` and `three-mesh-bvh` dependencies to compatible versions.
- Optimized bundle size by configuring `vite.config.ts` with:
    - `target: 'esnext'` for better tree-shaking.
    - Adjusted `chunkSizeWarningLimit`.
    - Strategic `manualChunks` for Three.js libraries.
- Added `.vercelignore` for improved cache control.
- Integrated `rollup-plugin-visualizer` for bundle analysis.
- Added Vercel Analytics to `src/App.tsx` for performance monitoring.
